# Greetings, fellow adventurer! 👋  

Welcome to my creative space, where code meets imagination and passion for projects never stops growing.  

Here’s a little about me:  

My projects revolve around things I love: game programming, 3D modeling, web development and problem-solving with code. I focus on creating things that are both useful and fun, all while challenging myself to learn something new with every line of code.  

## Current projects:  
- **Student X**: A web platform connecting students to opportunities.  
- **3D assets**: Creating characters, environments, and game objects for future game projects.  
- **RPG Adventure Game**: A text-based Java game with modular architecture and 3D navigation.  

## Learning never stops:  
- Leveling up my **game programming** skills with Unity.  
- Enhancing my **3D modeling and texturing** techniques in Blender to craft game-ready assets.  
- Exploring web development, from **Cloudflare integration** to responsive design.  

## Things I’m passionate about:  
- Game development and blending code with design.  
- Solving problems with Object-Oriented Programming in Java.  
- Creating assets that come to life in virtual worlds.  

## Let’s talk about:  
Whether it’s Java, Blender, or project ideas, I’m always up for a conversation about creating something awesome.  

## Fun fact:  
Despite being a perfectionist, I believe the best work comes from making room for imperfection and embracing the process.
