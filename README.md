# Hello there! 👋

> Game Developer | 3D Modeler | Software Engineer with a passion for Java

## About Me
Welcome to my creative space, where code meets imagination and passion for projects never stops growing! I'm a software engineer and 3D artist currently associated with **ISEL (Instituto Superior De Engenharia De Lisboa)**, specializing in Java, game mechanics, AI systems, and 3D modeling.

My projects revolve around things I love: game programming, 3D modeling, web development, and problem-solving with code. I focus on creating experiences that are both useful and fun, all while challenging myself to learn something new with every line of code.
