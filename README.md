# Hey, I’m Rafael

I study Software & Multimedia Engineering at ISEL. Most of my free time goes into building games, learning how to do things better, or getting way too deep into projects I started "just to test an idea."

Right now, I’m focused on **game programming** with Unity. I also know my way around Java (one of my favorite languages), model game assets in **Blender**, build responsive websites (like the startup I co-founded, [StudentX](#studentx.pt)), and occasionally take on **freelance photo editing** when I want a break from code. 

## Game Dev

My projects are done with the purpose of learning more and having fun while doing so, lately I've been developing a horror game that I plan into adding on Play Store.

- **EcoSim**: A Java-based ecosystem sim with genetic mutations, seasons, physics-based movement and fractal tree generation.
- **RPG Adventure**: A fully playable text-based RPG in a 3D coordinate space (yes, really, I started by learning simple with Java).
- **Horror Co-op Puzzle Game for Android**: A Unity project inspired by *Granny*, but with body-swapping mechanics and local multiplayer design.

## 3D Modeling

- Modeled and textured a detailed **abandoned wooden house** for Unity.
- Designed a **rigged humanoid character** with sculpted detail, custom textures and full animation cycles.
- Always improving topology, baking and PBR workflows.

## Skills

**Languages & Tools**:  
Java, C#, Unity, Blender, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Git, GitHub

**Concepts**:  
Object-Oriented Programming, Game Physics, Responsive Design, AI Behaviors, Clean&Optimized Code

## Side Projects

- **StudentX** – A platform made by 3 students (me + 2 friends) to connect other students to real opportunities. It went from a fun idea to a serious project after we entered TecStorm 2025 (a big hackathon in Portugal). Still improving it today.
- **Game Jams** – I’ve participated in a few and I love how they force you to build fast.

## What I'm Working On

- Getting better at Unity
- Improving my Blender workflow
- Launching StudentX with my team
- Not rewriting the same code to make it prettier three times in one week. Maybe.

Let’s build something. Or break it and figure out why it broke.
